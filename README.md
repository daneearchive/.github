## 📂 About
- This organization serves as hub for storing my unmaintained & unfinished projects/repos. A lot of these repos need to be completely rewritten, but that doesn't mean they are broken.

## 📜 Repository Structure
Each repository within the organization is categorized as follows:
- **Completed Projects**: Fully developed projects that are no longer updated.
- **Unfinished Projects**: Projects that were started but never fully completed.
